# Formal Uptane Models

This repository contains the formal Uptane models. Uptane.aadl defines the compressed model to be analyzed by Cyber Resiliency Verifier ([https://github.com/ge-high-assurance/VERDICT]()), an instrumentation of the Kind 2 model checker ([https://kind2-mc.github.io/kind2/]()). The cryptographic aspects of the protocol are modeled in Tamarin ([https://tamarin-prover.github.io/]())-- more details can be found in the `tamarin_models` directory.
